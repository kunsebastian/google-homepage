From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
In this project I built a simple re-creation of my country's Google.com homepage. From the knowledge of HTML and CSS I have obtained so far, I was able to arrange the elements where I wanted them to be and add different colours and styles.
